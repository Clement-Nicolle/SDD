    "Because most machine learning algorithms depend on the assumption that training and testing data are sampled independently from the same distribution, it is common practice to shuffle at random the training and testing sets. Nevertheless, this article suggests this is not always the best solution, in fact the origin of your data can contain some useful details and shuffling between all of them can discard some information. To adress this issue, the authors purpose another way of training model.\n",

    "The reason is that your CNN achieved a good training error minimization thanks to a cheat : classfying green and grassy landscape as cows and beige and aride one as camels. In fact, your model has exploited a spurious correlation (between lanscapes and types of animal) to classify your data. Imagine your data comes from two different sources or environnements : in the first one 90% of cows are in a green landscape, in the second one only 70%. Shuffling both of them will lose this information and perhaps misslead to the utilisation of landscape to determine if an animal is a cow. In keeping both environnement and study them disctinclty, you can notice that there is a strong (but spurious) link between grassy environnement and cow that should be discarded."

    "$$w\\circ\\Phi = (w\\circ\\Psi^{-1})\\circ(\\Psi\\circ\\Phi) = \\bar w\\circ\\bar \\Phi$$\n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "This observation is in fact a real issue for our study case. Indeed, if you consider the invertible mapping $\\Psi_{\\gamma}(h) = \\gamma\\cdot h$, the distance $\\mathbb{D}_{lin}(w,\\Phi,e) = \\mathbb{D}_{lin}(\\dfrac1\\gamma \\cdot w,\\gamma\\cdot\\Phi,e)$ tends to zero by letting $\\gamma$ tend to zero, while the ERM term $R^e((\\dfrac1\\gamma \\cdot w) \\circ (\\gamma\\cdot\\Phi))$ is not affected. This is due to the fact that we dealing with an over-parametrized problem.\n",
    "To fix it, the solution is to choose a regressor $\\bar w$ and to restrict our search on data representations for which the optimal classifier on each environnement is the same fixed classifier $\\bar w$. $$$$\n",

With such a choice, only the first component of the data representation would matter. As it could be surprising, the authors provides a demonstration in the case where the data representation is linear. You can find the explanation in part *3.1.4 Scalar fixed classifiers $\\bar w$ are sufficient to monitor invariance* (*p 8*) and the demonstration of the theorem used in Appendix *B.2 Proof of Theorem 4* (*pp 27-28*)\n",

That's a little too many for an efficient enumeration. Of course, most of the possible images will never occur in a Breakout game and the true state space is actually a much smaller subset of the full set of possible images.
